# Github Homework

Rodney J. Dyer


## Activity Overview

This activity will allow you to test out and evaluate the use of GitHub and GitHub Classroom in for this class.  You have already registered with GitHub and have a home repository.  

You have also (apparently) already been able to access github classroom and download this repository.  This is how all of the work in this class will be given and turned in, through [Dyerlab GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/7610458-environmental-data-literacy-2022).   For each assignment:  

1. I will send out an invite to the repository.
2. You will clone it to your computer and inside there will be:
    - You can then read over the README file for a general overview and instructions.
    - Additional Resources will be in the repository for your use.
    - One or more Homework/In-Class activities will be present.
4. You will complete these items.
5. To turn in, you will make a final *Commit* and then *Push* the change to back to the [Dyerlab GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/7610458-environmental-data-literacy-2022).  See the `narrative.md` for how to do this (although it will become second nature after a very short time). 


## Activity

To see how this is going to work, you will modify this document and then commit and push it back to me then we will have a little back-and-forth in this repository so you can see the feedback and revision process.

*Do this:*

1. Change the top YOUR NAME HERE to your actual name and in the space below tell me your favorite color and movie.
2. Commit these changes and make a comment in the commit that this is the version intended to be turned in.
3. Push this repository back up to GitHub.
4. I will make a comment on it (you'll be notified), and ask for one more thing.
5. You'll then have to pull the changes I've made down to your computer, answer the question, and then commit and push it back up to GitHub.
